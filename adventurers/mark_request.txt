## How to Run My Program

Assuming we have taken your crate, without any compilation; what commands will start the game?

> $ cargo run path/to/map.ron first_quest

## Design Excellence

During the assignment we make suggestions for "design excellence". Please list all those
things you did, and where we can find them in your program.

> - TODO

If you made any other design choices you think demonstrate an equivalent level
of design excellence, please list them below (including where to find them).
Note, we suggest you check with a tutor that your design is in fact excellent
before adding something below:

## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.
