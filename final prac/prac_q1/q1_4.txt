Assume we currently have the following code:

let my_str = String::from("hello");

1. You can get a shared borrow by:
    let my_share = &my_str;

2. You cannot turn a shared borrow into an exclusive borrow since a shared borrow is read-only and it cannot mutate the object.

3. An exclusive borrow is allowed to read and mutate the object. If the mutablity is nor required, you can 'downgrade' it into a shared borrow.
