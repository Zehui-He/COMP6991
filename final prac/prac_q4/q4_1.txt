A possible case is that he wants to save some type T inside a vector.

In his first implementation, the type saved inside the vector is fixed. The parameter that on the function cannot define the type he wants to save inside
the vector.

While in his second implementation, the type parameter is on the struct definition. This would allow him to use a generic type to save any data type in 
the vector.
