The Option type is an enum that can return None or Some(type). This means there is nothing or something 
in the returned value. While the Result type can return Ok(type) or Err(type). This means there is some 
result or there is an error. 

Option: it can be used in poping the last item from a vector. If there is no item in the vector, it should 
return None. If there is item in the vector, return Some(type).

Result: it can be used in reading a file. If there is an error occur while reading the file, for example, 
access denied, the Result should return an Err(AccessDenied). Otherwise it should return Ok(file).
