1.
This is not good in rust because all of the nodes are holding a share reference 
of each other. This make the nodes are impossible to mutate, i.e. obtain an 
exclusive reference, due to the existance of the share reference.

As the nodes holds a reference of another node, it is required to involk liftime. 
If one of the referenced node is dropped, the nodes which hold a reference of the 
dropped node would also dropped. This would lead to the breakdwon of the struct.
