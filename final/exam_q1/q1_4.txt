1.
Issue: The user need to check the returned number to see if the file is opened.
Fix: A better implementation is to return a Result(OK(file_id), Err(error_code)).


2.
Issue: the read_file function would not work as the file_id parameter has 
a type of i32, which is mismatched with the type of file_id in the open_file 
function.
Fix: change the file_id in read_file function to u32.

3. 
Issue: the buffer is a share borrow. No content can be written into the buffer.
Fix: change the buffer in read_file function to buffer: &mut [u8].
