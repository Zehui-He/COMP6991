The first approach means the function would take slice of ONE concrete type 
which implemented the Car trait. While the second approach would can take a 
slice of MULTIPLE types that implemented the Car trait. The Box wrapper is to 
fix the size of input parameter regardless what concrete type is given.

If the all the cars can be represented in the same struct, I would choose the 
first approch. Otherwise I would choose the second approach.
