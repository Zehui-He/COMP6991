Issue 1: the thread are not joined at the end so the main thread won't wait 
them to finish. That's why he needs to loop from 0 to 1999.

Issue 2: he can combine pushing and adding in 1 step with one mutex.lock. The 
lock and unlock operation can be costly.

I partially agree with Zain. In rust, it can save you from data racing 
or undefined behavirous. However, it cannot safe you from logic mistakes, 
which might be a bigger problem.
