# IRIS Mark Request

(You should put an [X] in boxes with completed features.
Lines starting with ">" are additional comments.)

[X] The server can be started with the command `cargo run 127.0.0.1 6991`.

[X] When a 'NICK' message is sent, the server stores the relevant information from it.

[X] When a 'USER' message is sent after a 'NICK', the server replies with a RPL_WELCOME.
> The RPL_WELCOME message will be sent regardless the order of NICK and USER message.

[X] The RPL_WELCOME contains the user's full name from the 'USER' message.

[X] Non-'NICK'/'USER' messages are ignored until the user has sent both.
> A new error code is used to indicate the error that the user is not register in the server.

[X] When a user sends a 'PING' message, an appropriate 'PONG' is sent back.

[X] When a user sends a 'QUIT' message, their connection is dropped.

[X] When a user sends a 'PRIVMSG' message to themselves, it is sent back to them.

[X] Multiple users can join the same server.

[X] Messages can be sent from one user to another.

[X] A user can 'JOIN' a channel.
> When a user try to join a non-exist channel, the server would create the channel and the user would join automatically.
> When a user join an already joined channel, a new error code would be shown.
> A user can join multiple channel at the same time. 

[X] A user can 'PART' a channel.
> If a user try to part a non-exist channel, the server will show a new error code saying that the channel doesn't exist.
> If a user try to part a non-joined channel, the server would shwo a new error code saying the user doesn't join the channel.

[X] All relevant messages sent by users inside a channel are sent to every other member of that channel.

[X] My design never stores messages, and deletes users as soon as they have left the server.

[ ] It is possible to set reminders, using the following command (change this if you'd like)
> PRIVMSG remindbot :10s tfpk :Remind me of something.

[ ] I have provided an "example" plugin, which explains how somebody
    else can interface with my plugin system.

## Design Excellence

During the assignment we make suggestions for "design excellence". Please list all those
things you did, and where we can find them in your program.

> - TODO

If you made any other design choices you think demonstrate an equivalent level
of design excellence, please list them below (including where to find them).
Note, we suggest you check with a tutor that your design is in fact excellent
before adding something below:

## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.
